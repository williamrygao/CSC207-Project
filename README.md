## Installation Instructions

Prerequisites:
Before installing Joe's Bookstore, ensure you have/can access the following:

**1. Install IntelliJ (Preferred IDE)**

   Purpose: IntelliJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) tailored for Java development and is highly recommended for this project.
   While it’s not strictly required, it offers advanced features that will enhance your productivity. 
   [Software installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html)
   
   **Notes:**
   
   **Ultimate vs Community:** 
   The Ultimate version includes features like generating UML diagrams and more advanced integrations.
   While the Community Edition is sufficient to get started, the Ultimate version is preferred for full functionality.
   
   **Plugins:** Install plugins for enhanced functionality (e.g., UML diagram generation, code analysis).
   Instructions for [installing plugins](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo)
   
   **Recommended Plugins:**
   
   - Code Style & Best Practices: CheckStyle-IDEA, SonarLint
   - Visualization & UML: Java Visualizer, PlantUML Integration, Diagrams.net Integration
   
**3. Install Java**

   Install JDK 11+ (JDK 17+ recommended) via [IntelliJ]( https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#manage_sdks).
   Follow these instructions to download and set up JDK.

**4. GoogleBooksAPI (Data Access)**

   Generate an API key to make calls to the Google Books API, which Joe's Bookstore uses to retrieve detailed book data. Instructions can be found at [Google Books API Guide](https://developers.google.com/books/overview). Once you have your API key, store it in a file called api_key.env in your local repository, in the following format:

```bash
API_KEY="your API key here"   
```

**5. Firebase Account & Firebase SDK (For contributors):**

   Set up a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account. Once you’ve created a Firebase project, you can generate an API key and the Firebase configuration object. In src/main/resources/, include a file serviceAccount.json in the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "csc207project-ed2f9",
  "private_key_id": "your private key ID here",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n your private key here \n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-d6nlw@csc207project-ed2f9.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "105179899008478085244",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/firebase-adminsdk-d6nlw%40csc207project-ed2f9.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```

**6. Git:**

   Git is required for cloning the repository. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads.)

**Special Notes:**

IntelliJ is highly recommended for managing dependencies, building the project, and working with version control. 
While it's not required, using it will make tasks like debugging and testing more efficient.

**For MacOS:** Ensure to download the .dmg version and follow the Mac-specific installation steps.

**For Windows:** Use the .exe installer and follow Windows-specific instructions for installation.
Currently, our project does not support Android implementation, but it’s a feature planned for future updates.
